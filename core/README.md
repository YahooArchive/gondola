## Unit Tests

The unit tests are located in ```src/test/java/com/yahoo/gondola/core/GondolaTest.java```.
To run the unit tests without having to build the package:
```
mvn test
```

To run a single test, for example, the test called 'missingEntry':
```
mvn test -Dtest=GondolaTest#missingEntry
```

## Tsunami Test

This stress test is designed to find bugs in the Raft implementation. Here's how it works:

1. The test creates N writer threads for each node in the Raft cluster.
2. A writer thread has an id and a private counter and attempts to write its thread id and counter value to its assigned node. When a write succeeds, the counter is incremented. Writes by threads assigned to the current leader are expected to succeed whereas writes by threads threads assigned to non-leaders are expected to get exceptions.
3. A single reader thread reads Raft entries, one-at-a-time, from each node in round-robin fashion and ensures that the entries are identical.
4. The reader also records the counter values for every writer and checks that the latest counter values are monotonically increasing.
5. A restarter thread randomly and continuously restarts nodes to simulate random server failures.
6. The Tsunami storage implementation induces random failures on all storage operations.
7. The Tsunami network implementation generates random read, write, and connection failures on all networking operations. The wrapper will also delay and duplicate sent messages.


#### Running Tsunami

To run the Tsunami test you will need access to a MySQL database. Edit ```conf/gondola-tsunami.conf``` and
set the fields - url, user, password - with the correct credentials to your database.
```
storage_mysql {
  class = com.yahoo.gondola.impl.MySqlStorage
  url = "jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/gondola"
  user = root
  password = root
}
```
The test will automatically create the necessary tables if it doesn't find them.

In one console, run the gondola agent command. This process listens for commands to start and stop a gondola instance.
```
> ./bin/gondola-agent.sh 
2015-09-27 10:07:58,638 INFO Initialize system, kill all gondola processes
2015-09-27 10:07:59,973 INFO Listening on port 1200
...
```

In another console, run the tsunami test:
```
> ./bin/tsunami.sh

```
Run the tsunimi test for as long as you can, days if possible. It will continously try to find an error in the Raft implementation. As it runs, it periodically prints out its status:
```
writes: 640, reads: 645, errors: 259...
```
As long as the number of write and reads continue to increase, the test is running properly.

If tsunami does find an issue, the test will exit and print one of two types of errors:

* Command at index X...does not match...": This error indicates that
  not all hosts are returning the same value at index X.

* Command at index X for writer...is not one bigger than last index:
  This error indicates that the counter written by a writer is not
  equal to or one larger than it's last written value. Either a value
  was lost or an older value reappeared.

## Usage

#### Terminology

| Term    | Description |
|:--------|-------------|
| Member  | A member refers a Raft node, which can be a follower, leader, or candidate. A member must be manually assigned a unique id in the config file. |
| Cluster | A cluster is a collection of members, only one of which can be the leader. A member can be only part of a one cluster. A cluster must be manually assigned a unique id in the config file. |
| Host    | Refers to a machine with an IP address and a port. A host can contain one or more clusters. All members are assigned a cluster and a primary host. All members running in the same host will share one port when communicating with the other memembers in the cluster. Hosts must be manually assigned a unique id in the config file. |
| Config | The entire topology of all clusters in a system is defined in a single config file. At the moment, dynamic reconfiguration of the topology is not supported. |
| Log Table | Each member has a logical log in which it writes all records to be committed. In Gondola, the log table contains a member_id column, which allows many members to share the same storage instance. At the moment, all logs are stored in a single database instance. We intend to enhance this so that each host can use a different database instance if needed. This means that all members running in a host will still share the same database instance.  |
| Gondola Instance | is a process that is running all the members residing in a host. The gondola instance provides a single port through which all the members in the instance can communicate with any other member on any other host. The gondola instance also provides a storage instance for all its members logs. |

#### Code

The first step in using Gondola is to copy the config file
```conf/gondola-sample.conf```. It contains a sample of a host/cluster
topology that you can modify to hold your topology. 
From this config file, you can create a Gondola instance.
The following are the lines of code to commit a command to the Raft log:
```
Config config = new Config(new File(configFile));
Gondola gondola = new Gondola(config, hostId);
Cluster cluster = gondola.getCluster(clusterId);
Command command = cluster.checkoutCommand();
command.commit(bytes, offset, len);
```

The following lines of code is used to retrieve committed commands from the Raft log:
```
Cluster cluster = gondola.getCluster(clusterId);
Command command = cluster.getCommittedCommand(index); // index starting from 1
String value = command.getString();
```

## Architecture

These are the major classes in the implementation:

| Class   | Description |
|:--------|-------------|
| Client  | Represents the client code. It is assumed that the client has many threads writing to the Raft log. |
| Cluster | Represents a set of Raft nodes, only one of which can be a leader. The Cluster object also has a pool of Command object which are used for committing and reading Raft commands. The Command objects are pooled to avoid needless garbage collection. |
| Config | Is an interface that provides access to all configuration information. The Config implementation can be a file or an adapter retrieving configs from some storage. |
| Connection | Represents a channel of communication between the local and remote member. |
| Exchange | Is reponsible for creating a Connection between the local and remote member. |
| Gondola | The Gondola instance that represents all the nodes in a particular host.
| Member | Represents a Raft node. All commands that are written by the client are placed in the CommandQueue. When the commands are processed from the CommandQueue, they are processed in as large as a batch that will fit into a Raft message. The command is assigned a Raft index. After the message is sent to the other members, the processed Command objects are moved to the WaitQueue, blocking the client until the Command's Raft index has been committed. The IncomingQueue holds Raft messages that need to be processed. |
| Message Pool | All Raft messages are represented by Message objects. The Message objects are pooled to avoid garbage collection. Message objects are reference counted, so they can be added to more than one outgoing queue for delivery to a remote member. |
| Peer | Represents remote members that this host needs to communicate with. The peer is responsible for sending and receiving messages from the remote member. The Peer is also responsible for backfilling the remote member if necessary. |
| SaveQueue | Is responsible for persisting messages in the SaveQueue to storage. The SaveQueue employs threads to allow inserts to happen concurrently. |
| Storage | Is an interface that can be implemented by any storage system that can provide strong consistency. |

The following is a rough class diagram of the major classes showing the major relationships between the classes:
